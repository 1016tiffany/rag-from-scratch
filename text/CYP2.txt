1. What are the 4 types of data sources? List each of them, give a brief definition, and at
least one example. Why might you want to give 2 examples of each? To practice your
understanding of these topics!
1. L-data

● Definition: “Life record data or information concerning the person that can be obtained

from their life history or life record” (Pervin, Cervone, & John, 2009, p. 38).

● Example 1: Academic records showing grades and educational achievements.
● Example 2: Criminal records indicating past arrests or convictions.

● Definition: “Observer data or information provided by knowledgeable observers such as

parents, friends, or teachers” (Pervin, Cervone, & John, 2009, p. 38).

● Example 1: A supervisor’s evaluation of an employee’s job performance.
● Example 2: Peer ratings of sociability and friendliness in a social setting.

● Definition: “Test data or information obtained from experimental procedures or

standardized tests” (Pervin, Cervone, & John, 2009, p. 38).
● Example 1: Scores from an intelligence test (e.g., IQ test).
● Example 2: Results from a behavioral experiment measuring reaction time to stimuli.

2. O-data

3. T-data

4. S-data

● Definition: “Self-reporting data or information provided by the subject” (Pervin, Cervone,

● Example 1: Responses to the Big Five Inventory, a questionnaire assessing the five

major dimensions of personality.

self-worth.

2. Some research in personality psychology uses the experimental approach, other
research uses the correlational approach. Define each approach briefly and give an
example. Why are both needed? Let's say you want to study the link between negative
emotion and suicidal ideation--could you justify ethically doing an experimental study on
that topic?
Experimental Approach:

● Definition: An approach to research in which the experimenter manipulates a variable of

interest, usually by assigning different research participants, at random, to different
experimental conditions.

● Example: A study investigating the impact of sleep deprivation on cognitive performance.

Participants are randomly assigned to either a sleep-deprived group or a well-rested
group, and their cognitive performance is measured and compared.

Correlational Approach:

● Definition: An approach to research in which existing individual differences are measured

and related to one another, rather than being manipulated as in experimental research.

● Example: A study examining the relationship between levels of physical activity and

happiness in a large sample of adults. Researchers collect data on participants' physical
activity and happiness levels and analyze the correlation between these variables.

Why Both Approaches Are Needed

● Comprehensive Understanding: The experimental approach provides insights into

causation by controlling variables and manipulating conditions, while the correlational
approach identifies natural relationships and patterns in real-world settings. Together,
they offer a more comprehensive understanding of psychological phenomena.

● Practical and Ethical Constraints: Some research questions cannot be addressed

experimentally due to practical or ethical constraints. Correlational studies allow
researchers to investigate these questions by observing naturally occurring variables.

Studying the Link Between Negative Emotion and Suicidal Ideation
Ethical Considerations:

● Experimental Study: Conducting an experimental study on the link between negative

emotion and suicidal ideation raises significant ethical concerns. Manipulating variables
that could induce negative emotions or suicidal thoughts is highly unethical and could
cause harm to participants.

● Correlational Study: A correlational approach is more appropriate and ethical for

studying this link. Researchers can collect data on individuals' experiences of negative
emotions and any reports of suicidal ideation through surveys, interviews, or existing
medical records. This method avoids directly inducing harmful states while still allowing
for the investigation of associations between these variables.

Justification for Ethical Considerations
Given the sensitive nature of suicidal ideation, an experimental study would not be ethically
justifiable because:
1. Risk of Harm: Manipulating emotional states to observe effects on suicidal ideation could lead
to severe psychological distress or actual harm to participants.
2. Informed Consent and Beneficence: Ethical research requires minimizing harm and
maximizing benefits. Inducing negative emotions or suicidal thoughts violates these principles.
3. Alternative Methods: Correlational studies, longitudinal research, and naturalistic
observations can provide valuable insights without compromising participant safety.

In conclusion, while both experimental and correlational approaches are essential in personality
psychology for different reasons, studying sensitive topics like the link between negative
emotion and suicidal ideation must prioritize ethical considerations, making the correlational
approach the appropriate choice in this context.

3. What are the nomothetic and idiographic approaches to personality assessment? What
can you say about their (relative) strengths and weaknesses?
Nomothetic Approach

● Definition: Strategies of “assessment and research in which the primary goal is to identify
a common set of principles or laws that apply to all members of a population of persons”
(Pervin, Cervone, & John, 2009, p. 42).

● Strengths:

- Generalizability: By examining traits and behaviors across large samples, the

nomothetic approach provides findings that can be generalized to broader
populations.

- Comparability: Standardized measures allow for direct comparisons between
individuals, making it easier to identify common traits and predict behaviors.

- Efficiency: It uses standardized tests and quantitative methods, which are

efficient and can be administered to large groups relatively quickly.

● Weaknesses:

-

Individual Uniqueness: It may overlook the unique aspects of an individual's
personality, focusing instead on general trends and averages.

- Context Insensitivity: The approach might fail to account for the contextual factors

that influence personality, such as culture, environment, or specific life
experiences.

● Example: The Big Five Inventory, which measures five broad personality traits

(Openness, Conscientiousness, Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism).

Idiographic Approach

● Strengths:

● Definition: Strategies of “assessment and research in which the primary goal is to obtain

a portrait of the potentially unique, idiosyncratic individual” (Pervin, Cervone, & John,
2009, p. 41).

-

-

In-depth Understanding: Provides a rich, detailed understanding of an individual’s
personality, capturing the nuances and complexities of their personal
experiences.

- Contextual Sensitivity: It takes into account the specific contexts and

environments that shape an individual’s personality, providing a more holistic
view.

- Personal Relevance: The findings are highly relevant to the individual being

studied, often leading to insights that are directly applicable to their life.

Limited Generalizability: Findings from idiographic assessments cannot be easily
generalized to other individuals or populations, as they focus on individual cases.

- Resource Intensive: This approach is often time-consuming and requires

significant resources to gather and analyze detailed qualitative data.

- Subjectivity: The qualitative nature of the data can introduce subjectivity, making

it harder to replicate findings or draw objective conclusions.

● Weaknesses:

● Example: Case studies and narrative interviews that explore an individual’s personal

history and unique traits.

4. What do you know about correlations? Make sure you cover: (a) what is the highest
and lowest number a correlation can be? (b) what do these correlations mean: +.30? .08?
-.45? (c) What is the correlation between taking a daily aspirin and living without a heart
attack for the next 10 years? (d) What is a typical correlation in research, such as in a
study of the link between self-reported extraversion and attaining a leadership function in
your sorority/fraternity? You read a study on this topic and the authors claim a
correlation of .89--what do you think about that result? (e) Does correlation imply a
causal influence of variable A on variable B? Illustrate your answer by discussing the
finding that physical height is correlated with performance on intelligence tests.

Highest and Lowest Number a Correlation Can Be

● The correlation coefficient ranges from -1.00 to +1.00.
● +1.00: Perfect positive correlation, where an increase in one variable perfectly predicts

● -1.00: Perfect negative correlation, where an increase in one variable perfectly predicts a

an increase in the other.

decrease in the other.

● 0: No correlation, indicating no linear relationship between the variables.

Interpretation of Specific Correlations

● +.30: A moderate positive correlation, indicating a moderate tendency for one variable to

● .08: A weak positive correlation, suggesting a very slight tendency for one variable to

● -.45: A moderate negative correlation, indicating a moderate tendency for one variable to

increase as the other increases.

increase as the other increases.

decrease as the other increases.

Correlation Between Daily Aspirin and Living Without a Heart Attack

● The correlation between taking a daily aspirin and living without a heart attack for the

next 10 years is .08. This indicates a small positive relationship, meaning taking a daily
aspirin is slightly associated with a reduced risk of heart attack.

Typical Correlation in Research

● Typical correlations in psychological and social research are often around .30 to .40.

This indicates a moderate relationship.

● Study Example: If a study reports a correlation of .89 between self-reported extraversion
and attaining a leadership function in a sorority/fraternity, this result is unusually high for
psychological research. Such a high correlation is rare and might indicate potential
issues like measurement bias, a very specific and homogenous sample, or possibly even
errors in the study's methodology.

Correlation and Causality

● Correlation Does Not Imply Causation: A correlation between two variables does not

mean that one variable causes the other to change.

● Example: The correlation between physical height and performance on intelligence tests.
● Finding: Taller individuals might score slightly higher on intelligence tests.
● Explanation: This does not mean being taller causes higher intelligence. Several third
variables could explain this correlation, such as nutrition, socioeconomic status, and
overall health, which can influence both height and cognitive development. These
confounding factors can lead to a spurious correlation where the observed relationship is
due to shared influences rather than a direct causal link between height and intelligence.

5. Define reliability as presented in lecture and make a table with the 4 major kinds of
reliability indexes, showing what aspect of generalizability each of them covers. For
example, interjudge agreement examines generalizability across ... Is a retest correlation
of .80 OK? How about a retest correlation of .35?
Reliability: The extent to which “observations are stable, dependable, and can be replicated”
(Pervin, Cervone, & John, 2009, p. 67).

Type of Reliability

Aspect of Generalizability
Covered

Description

Test-Retest Reliability

Generalizability across time

Parallel Forms Reliability

Generalizability across
different forms of the test

Split-Half/Internal
Consistency Reliability

Generalizability across items
within the same test

Measures the consistency of
results when the same test is
administered to the same
individuals at different points
in time. A high retest
reliability indicates that the
test produces stable results
over time.

Assesses the consistency of
results across different
versions or forms of the same
test. If two different forms of a
test produce similar results,
the test is considered to have
high parallel form reliability.

Evaluates the consistency of
results across items within a
single test. It is often
measured using Cronbach's
alpha, which assesses how
well the items on a test
measure the same construct.

Interjudge/Interrater
Agreement

Generalizability across
different observers or raters

Examines the consistency of
measurements when different
observers or raters assess
the same individuals. High
interjudge reliability indicates
that different raters provide
similar ratings or
assessments.

Evaluating Retest Correlations

● Retest Correlation of .80: A retest correlation of .80 is considered good. It indicates high
reliability, meaning that the test produces consistent results over time and can be trusted
to yield stable measurements of the construct being assessed.

● Retest Correlation of .35: A retest correlation of .35 is generally considered low and

indicates poor reliability. This suggests that the test may not produce stable results over
time, making it less dependable for measuring the construct consistently.

6. Define validity and the 3 major aspects we need to consider when we think about
validity, as defined in lecture. Explain each of the 3 aspects using an example. Ideally,
find your own example. If you cannot, use the example from lecture (i.e., if you used Prof.
John's cool new Conscientiousness test to pick your new roommates--what validity
questions should you consider?).
Validity: The extent to which “observations reflect the phenomena or constructs of interest to us
(also “construct validity”)” (Pervin, Cervone, & John, 2009, p. 67).

Three Major Aspects of Validity
1. Content Validity:

2. Criterion Validity:

● Definition: Content validity refers to the extent to which a test comprehensively covers
the construct it aims to measure. It ensures that the test items are representative of the
entire domain of the construct.

● Example: Suppose I am developing a test to measure mathematical ability in high school

students. To ensure content validity, the test should include items that cover all relevant
areas of high school mathematics, such as algebra, geometry, and calculus, rather than
focusing solely on one area.

● Definition: Criterion validity evaluates how well a test correlates with an outcome or

criterion that it should be related to. This can be assessed through concurrent validity
(correlation with current outcomes) or predictive validity (correlation with future
outcomes).

● Example: Imagine developing a new job performance assessment tool for sales

employees, to establish criterion validity, I would compare the test scores with actual
sales performance data. If higher test scores correlate with better sales performance, the
test has good criterion validity.

3. Construct Validity:

● Definition: Construct validity assesses whether a test truly measures the theoretical

construct it is intended to measure. This involves evaluating the test's relationships with
other variables and ensuring it behaves as expected according to the theory.

● Example: If you create a test to measure anxiety, you would examine its construct

validity by looking at its correlations with other measures of anxiety and related
constructs, such as stress and depression. If the test scores correlate highly with other
anxiety measures and moderately with related constructs like stress, it has good
construct validity.

Using Prof. John's cool new Conscientiousness test to pick your new roommates, I would
consider the following validity questions:
1. Content Validity:

● Question: Does the Conscientiousness test cover all aspects of conscientiousness, such

as organization, dependability, diligence, and punctuality?

● Example: Review the test items to ensure they include questions about keeping

commitments, maintaining a tidy living space, managing time effectively, and following
through on tasks.

2. Criterion Validity:

● Question: Does the test predict relevant outcomes, such as the cleanliness and

orderliness of the roommates' living spaces and their reliability in shared responsibilities?
● Example: Compare the test scores with current ratings of cleanliness and reliability from
existing roommates. Additionally, track these outcomes over the first few months to see if
higher scores on the Conscientiousness test predict better living habits and shared
responsibilities.

3. Construct Validity:

● Question: Does the test accurately measure the construct of conscientiousness, and

does it correlate with other established measures of conscientiousness and related
constructs?

● Example: Administer another well-validated Conscientiousness measure, such as a

subscale of the Big Five Inventory, alongside Prof. John's test. Evaluate the correlation
between the scores. Also, examine correlations with related traits, such as
agreeableness (moderate positive correlation), and unrelated traits like extraversion (low
correlation).
